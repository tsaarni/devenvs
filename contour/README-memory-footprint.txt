- Predicates

  "If youâ€™re looking to filter out objects to limit memory utilization this is not the place to do that. This is where the cache comes in handy."

- SelectorByObject
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/master/designs/use-selectors-at-cache.md
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pull/1435
  Works on server-side but cannot do complicated queries like "secrets with type kubernetes.io/tls and Opaque"

- cache.TransformFunc
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72932546/filtering-items-are-stored-in-kubernetes-shared-informer-cache
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pull/1805
  used for e.g stripping managedFields and annotations metadata
  "These caches can have tens of thousands of objects. We have found that some our controllers are being OOM-killed more frequently recently since the addition of managedFields."

- namespace filtering
  MultiNamespacedCacheBuilder(watchedNamespaces) or manager.Options{Namespace: watchedNamespace}

- metadata-only watches
